# Classic-Battleship-Game
This Python project lays the foundation for a classic Battleship game. It includes grid setup, random ship placement, and basic game initialization. This prototype demonstrates core game mechanics and is ready for the implementation of the gameplay loop (player turns, targeting, win/loss conditions)
